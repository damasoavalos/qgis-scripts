# QGIS Scripts by Damaso Avalos

This repository contains a collection of custom scripts for QGIS, aimed at enhancing the functionality and efficiency of GIS tasks. These scripts are designed to automate common geospatial operations, streamline data processing, and provide new tools for spatial analysis.

## About

Damaso Avalos has over 10 years of experience in GIS application development, with a strong foundation in spatial data manipulation and software engineering. This repository is a curated selection of scripts developed to address specific GIS needs, leveraging the power of QGIS for spatial data analysis and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Scripts to automate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data cleaning, and preparation tasks.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Tools for performing complex spatial operations, calculations, and analyses.
- **Visualization**: Enhancements for creating advanced visual representations of spatial data in QGIS.
- **Utility Scripts**: General-purpose scripts to improve workflow efficiency and QGIS user experience.

## Installation

To use these scripts, you must have QGIS installed on your computer. Most scripts are developed for QGIS 3.x. Follow these steps to install and set up the scripts:
